==================
Configuration File
==================

Overview
========

This is the blueprint that defines an applications CI/CD workflow, container configuration, container host configuration,
and its dependencies per environment and data-center. The file should be written in yaml (json is also supported). The objects
in the configuration file have a cascading effect. Meaning that the objects defined deepest in the object structure take
precedent over previously defined values.  This allows for common configuration values to be shared as well as allowing
the flexibility to override values per individual operation.

.. Warning:: Configuration injection isn't included in this configuration file.

Terminology Explanation
=======================

Definitions:

=====================  ==========================================================================
freight-forwarder.yml  | Handles the organization of application services, environments and data-centers.

hosts                  | A server physical/virtual server that has the docker daemon running. The daemon must be configured
                       | to communicate via tcp.

service                | Multiple services are defined to make a project. A service could be an api, proxy, db, etc.

environments           | An object that is used to define where/how containers and images are
                       | being deployed, exported, and tested for each environment.

data centers           | An object that is used to define where/how containers and images are
                       | being deployed, exported, and tested for each data center.

registry               | The docker registry where images will be pushed.

Service Properties
==================

Each service object is a component that defines a specific service of a project.  An example would be an api or database.
Services can be built from a Dockerfile or pulled from an image in a docker registry.  The container and host 
configuration can be modified on a per service bases.

                                             | precedent over the build property.  
                                             | If a service object has both an image and build specified 
                                             | the image will exclusively be used.

Registries Properties
=====================
The registries object is a grouping of docker registries that images will be pulled from or pushed to. The alias of each
registry can be used in any image definition `image: docker_hub/library/centos:6.6`. By default docker_hub is provided for all users.
The default property will be set to docker_hub unless overridden with any of the defined registries.

These are properties required for authentication with a registry.  Currently basic and
registry_rubber auth are support. Dynamic auth uses `Registry Rubber`_ to support
nonce like basic auth credentials. Please refer to `Registry Rubber`_ documentation
for a deeper understanding of the service.

The Environments object is a grouping of instructions and configuration values that define the behavior for a CI/CD pipeline
based on environment and data center. The environments and data centers are both user defined.

    will pass these values to the injector to obtain the correct configuration data.

Export is the only action that allows you to have a specific unique hosts definition (this is a good place for a jenkins or build host).

.. Note:: To remove Freight Forwarders tagging scheme pass --no-tagging-scheme to the cli export command.
.. Warning:: When exporting images Freight Forwarder will use the service definition in deploy for any dependencies/dependents. In addition, if a command is provided in the config for the service being exported Freight Forwarder assumes any changes made should be committed into the image.

The hosts object is a collection of docker hosts in which Freight Forwarder will interact with when  deploying, exporting,
or testing.  Each service can have a collection of its own hosts but will default to the defaults definition or the
standard Docker environment variables: DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY, DOCKER_CERT_PATH.


===================== ======== ======================== =============================================================

Host Config Properties
======================

Host configuration properties can be included as a part of the the service definition.
This allows for greater control when configuring a container for specific requirements to operate. It is suggested that
a root level definition of a service be minimalistic compared to how it should be deployed in a specific environment or
data-center.

Refer to `Docker Docs`_ for the full list of of potential properties.

Container Config Properties
===========================

Container config properties are container configuration settings that can be changed by the developer to meet the container run time requirements.
These properties can be set at any level but the furthest in the object chain will take presidents. Please refer to
`Docker Docs`_ for a full list of properties.
